I'm currently pursuing Masters in International and Development Economics from Yale University. I graduated from Alma College with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics and Political Science with a focus on International Relations with dreams of helping people who haven’t been given their fair chance in society. My research and career interest lie at the nexus of international diplomacy, human rights law, and economics, and I have been fortunate to pursue relevant opportunities in vibrant Africa and Asia. My perpetual curiosity has been my driving force to find answers to questions that hinder the world’s growth.
