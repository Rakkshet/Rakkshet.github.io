International law is the foundation upon which the rules-based international order is built. It is a joint commitment by all states to perform their operations in compliance with agreed-upon laws that have evolved over time. The absolute commitment to its tenets by all United Nations member states is crucial in attempts to resolve any intractable conflict, including that between Israel and the Palestinians. On February 5, 2021, International Criminal Court (ICC) ruled that it has jurisdiction over the suspected war crimes and international law violations committed in Palestinian territory since 2014.[1] ICC's decision to open an inquiry into the situation in Palestine is significant as it unbolts the door for justice in Palestine. Justice being the first step toward achieving peace, as the latter is meaningless without the former. This paper analyzes how the ICC has tackled the central issue of whether it has jurisdiction over Palestinian territory since its conception and examines the significance and challenges of the ruling given in 2021, especially its role in achieving peace in Palestine.
